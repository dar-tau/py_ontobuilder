# Ontobuilder

This is a Python port to [Ontobuilder](https://github.com/shraga89/ontobuilderDev).

This can actually be modified to work with basically any Java package in JAR format by replacing the contents of `src/ontobuilder/jars` and adapting `src/ontobuilder/__init__.py` accordingly. 


## Installation
As of now, you must be in a **conda** environment, then simply run:
```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/dar-tau/py_ontobuilder.git
```

## Song

Qu'est-ce que c'est

Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa Python - far better!

Plu-, Plu-, Plug, Plug, Plug and Play!
